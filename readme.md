## How To Run It ##

Once it's installed, the syntax is:

`blrplt create path/to/folder "Do Action"`

For instance, this could be:

`blrplt create app/containers/HomePage "Get Tweets"`

And you'd get reducers/actions/constants/selectors for 'Get Tweets'.

Try it out! Though make sure you commit before you do.

## Notes ##

The codebase is horrible - I hashed it out one night while watching The Staircase. It also doesn't yet give you a 'saga'. No reason, just haven't gotten there yet.
